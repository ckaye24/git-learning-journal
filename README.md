My Git Essential Training Progress Log

## July 1, 2025 (TUESDAY)
- Watched Git Essential Training on LinkedIn.
- Learned the basic concepts of Git.
- I'm still not done watching the video, and I'm still in the process of learning how Git works.

  ## July 2, 2025 (WEDNESDAY)
  - Continued watching the video and installed and configured Git.
  - Applied all the knowledge I learned yesterday.
  - Set up a remote repository and clone it.
  - Created a file, staged it, committed it, and pushed it to the remote repository.
  - Learned about the .git folder, initializing a remote repository, and syncing it.
  - Completed the challenge of pushing my first code.
  - In my free time, I will continue watching the lesson on making changes to files and important Git concepts.
